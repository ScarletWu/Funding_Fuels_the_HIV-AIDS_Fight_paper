Caveats:
"1. About Metropolitan areas and Regions: Metropolitan area of residence at the time of diagnosis of AIDS is identified for"
"adult/adolescent patients residing in MSAs with 500,000 or more population. For adult/adolescent patients residing in an MSA"
"with less than 500,000 population, in a non-metropolitan area, or whose metropolitan area of residence is unknown, and for all"
"pediatric patients, Region of residence is identified."
"2. Only the metropolitan areas are displayed on the maps. Although regions are not displayed on the maps, regional data are"
"included in the quantile distributions when regions are included in the data results."
